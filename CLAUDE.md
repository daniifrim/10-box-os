# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

10-box OS is a web application implementing a proprietary business framework for client acquisition and management. It's a single-tenant SaaS platform designed for one teacher to oversee multiple consultants using the 10-box methodology.

## Commands

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd nextjs && npm install

# Run development server (usually already running)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

### Supabase Management
```bash
# Link to Supabase project (requires database password)
npx supabase link

# Push configuration changes
npx supabase config push

# Run migrations
npx supabase migrations up --linked

# Generate types from database
npx supabase gen types typescript --linked > nextjs/src/lib/database.types.ts
```

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router) with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with Row Level Security)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Supabase (backend/database)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with MFA support

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Supabase Client Management**: Three client types in `src/lib/supabase/`:
   - `client.ts`: Browser client for frontend operations
   - `server.ts`: Server client for SSR and API routes
   - `serverAdminClient.ts`: Admin client with service role key for privileged operations

2. **Row Level Security (RLS)**: All database tables use RLS policies to isolate data between users. Teacher sees all consultant data, consultants see only their own data, clients see only their portal data.

3. **Component Architecture**: 
   - Page components in `src/app/` follow Next.js App Router conventions
   - Shared components in `src/components/` with shadcn/ui base components in `ui/`
   - Layout components handle authentication and role-based access

## Business Logic

### User Hierarchy
1. **Teacher** (single instance): Oversees all consultants, monitors Box 2-4 daily tasks
2. **Consultants**: Work independently with their own Dream 100 prospects and clients
3. **Clients**: View-only access to their service portals after converting from prospects

### 10-Box Framework
- **Boxes 2-4** (Client Acquisition - tracked daily):
  - Box 2 (Identify): 5 avatar refinement tasks
  - Box 3 (Invite): 5 Dream 100 outreach tasks  
  - Box 4 (Converse): 5 conversation/decision tasks
- **Boxes 5-7** (Client Service): Onboarding, delivery with milestones, recap
- **Boxes 8-10** (Client Retention): Future scope

### Critical Workflows

1. **Prospect â†’ Client Conversion**: When Dream 100 contact status = "Buy", automatically:
   - Create client portal
   - Send magic link authentication email
   - Generate service milestones from template (1-day, 5-day, 30-day, or retainer)

2. **Daily Task Tracking**: Color indicators on teacher dashboard:
   - ðŸŸ¢ Green: All tasks complete
   - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Some incomplete (<3 days)
   - ðŸ”´ Red: Multiple overdue (>3 days)

## Database Schema Considerations

- User roles stored in Supabase Auth metadata
- Dream 100 contacts linked to consultant user ID
- Client portals linked to both consultant and client
- Task completion tracked with timestamps for daily monitoring
- File storage in Supabase Storage buckets with RLS policies

## Testing Approach

Since there's no test framework configured yet, when implementing features:
1. Test authentication flows manually with different user roles
2. Verify RLS policies work correctly (data isolation)
3. Test the critical prospect â†’ client conversion workflow
4. Ensure daily task tracking updates properly on teacher dashboard

## Security Notes

- Never expose service role key to frontend
- All client operations must use RLS-protected queries
- Magic links for client authentication (no passwords)
- MFA available for consultant/teacher accounts
- File uploads restricted by size (5MB) and type (PDF for documents)

## Development Tips

- The dev server is usually already running, check before starting a new one
- Always update `/docs/CHANGELOG.md` before committing changes
- Use existing shadcn/ui components from `src/components/ui/` before creating new ones
- Follow the established pattern for Supabase client usage based on context (browser vs server)
- When modifying database schema, create a new migration file in `supabase/migrations/`
