Here are detailed, actionable user stories with acceptance criteria:\n\n#### Teacher/Administrator User Stories:\n\n**Epic: Dashboard & Monitoring**\n- **User Story T1**: As a Teacher, I want to view a dashboard showing all consultants' progress across Boxes 2-4, so I can quickly identify who needs support.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria**:\n    - Given I'm logged in as a Teacher, when I access the dashboard, then I see a sortable table with columns: Consultant Name, Current Box, Progress %, Tasks Overdue, Last Activity Date\n    - Given a consultant has overdue tasks < 7 days, when viewing the dashboard, then their status shows as Yellow\n    - Given a consultant has overdue tasks > 7 days, when viewing the dashboard, then their status shows as Red\n    - Given all tasks are on track, when viewing the dashboard, then their status shows as Green\n\n- **User Story T2**: As a Teacher, I want to drill down into individual consultant details, so I can provide targeted support.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria**:\n    - Given I click on a consultant's name, when the detail view loads, then I see their task history, Dream 100 progress, and client portal activity\n    - Given I'm viewing consultant details, when I want to export their data, then I can download a CSV report\n    - Given I want to add notes, when I save a note on a consultant, then it's timestamped and visible in future sessions\n\n#### Consultant User Stories:\n\n**Epic: Dream 100 Management**\n- **User Story C1**: As a Consultant, I want to import my Dream 100 contacts via CSV upload, so I can quickly populate my database without manual entry.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria**:\n    - Given I have a CSV file with the required format, when I upload it, then all valid contacts are imported with success confirmation\n    - Given my CSV has invalid data, when I upload it, then I receive specific error messages for each invalid row\n    - Given I exceed 500 contacts, when uploading, then I receive an error message and no data is imported\n    - Given I want to download the template, when I click the template link, then a CSV with proper headers downloads\n\n- **User Story C2**: As a Consultant, I want to filter and search my Dream 100 contacts, so I can quickly find specific prospects.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria**:\n    - Given I have contacts in my database, when I apply filters (tag, relationship status, next contact date), then only matching contacts display\n    - Given I search by name or company, when I type in the search field, then results filter in real-time\n    - Given I want to clear filters, when I click \"Clear All\", then all contacts display again\n\n**Epic: Client Portal Management**\n- **User Story C3**: As a Consultant, I want to create branded client portals with customizable milestones, so my clients can track project progress.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria**:\n    - Given I'm creating a new portal, when I upload branding assets (profile pic 100x100px, banner 1200x200px), then they display correctly in the portal preview\n    - Given I want to customize milestones, when I add/edit/delete milestones (max 10), then changes save and reflect in the client view\n    - Given I complete a milestone, when I mark it as complete with timestamp, then the client sees the updated progress bar\n\n#### Client User Stories:\n\n**Epic: Portal Access & Tracking**\n- **User Story CL1**: As a Client, I want to view my project progress through a dedicated portal, so I can stay informed without contacting my consultant.\n  - **Acceptance Criteria**:\n    - Given I receive a portal link, when I access it, then I see my project milestones, progress bar, and consultant branding\n    - Given documents are uploaded, when I click on them, then they open in a new tab (PDFs only, max 5MB)\n    - Given I want contact info, when I scroll to the bottom, then I see my consultant's contact details\n\n### 2. **Clarify Technical Requirements**\n\nThe current technical section is incomplete. Here are specific implementation details:\n\n#### Database Schema (Supabase/PostgreSQL):\n```sql\n-- Users table (handles all user types)\nCREATE TABLE users (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n  role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('teacher', 'consultant', 'client')),\n  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),\n  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()\n);\n\n-- Consultants table\nCREATE TABLE consultants (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id),\n  teacher_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),\n  first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n  last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n  current_box INTEGER DEFAULT 1 CHECK (current_box BETWEEN 1 AND 10),\n  profile_picture_url TEXT,\n  banner_url TEXT,\n  welcome_text TEXT CHECK (LENGTH(welcome_text) <= 500)\n);\n\n-- Dream100 contacts table\nCREATE TABLE dream100_contacts (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n  consultant_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES consultants(id),\n  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n  company VARCHAR(255),\n  phone VARCHAR(50),\n  email VARCHAR(255),\n  linkedin_profile TEXT,\n  source VARCHAR(100),\n  relationship VARCHAR(100),\n  title VARCHAR(255),\n  preferred_communication VARCHAR(50),\n  latest_decision TEXT,\n  next_contact_date DATE,\n  is_dream_100 BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,\n  tags TEXT[],\n  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),\n  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()\n);\n```\n\n#### API Routes Structure:\n```\n/api/auth/\n  - POST /login\n  - POST /logout\n  - POST /register\n  - POST /reset-password\n\n/api/consultants/\n  - GET /{id} - Get consultant profile\n  - PUT /{id} - Update consultant profile\n  - GET /{id}/dream100 - Get Dream 100 contacts\n  - POST /{id}/dream100/import - CSV import\n  - GET /{id}/tasks - Get task status\n  - PUT /{id}/tasks/{taskId} - Update task completion\n\n/api/teachers/\n  - GET /{id}/dashboard - Get all consultants overview\n  - GET /{id}/consultants/{consultantId} - Get detailed consultant view\n\n/api/client-portals/\n  - POST / - Create new portal\n  - GET /{portalId} - Get portal (public access)\n  - PUT /{portalId} - Update portal milestones\n  - POST /{portalId}/documents - Upload document\n```\n\n### 3. **Add Missing Requirements**\n\n#### Data Validation Rules:\n- Email addresses must be valid format and unique per role\n- Phone numbers must be valid international format\n- File uploads: Images (JPG, PNG max 2MB), Documents (PDF max 5MB)\n- CSV imports must match exact column headers (case-sensitive)\n\n#### Security Requirements:\n- Password: Min 8 characters, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special character\n- Session timeout: 30 minutes of inactivity\n- Rate limiting: 100 API calls per minute per user\n- CORS policy for domain restrictions\n\n#### Error Handling:\n- User-friendly error messages for all validation failures\n- Graceful degradation when Supabase is unavailable\n- Retry logic for failed file uploads\n- 404 pages for invalid portal URLs\n\n### 4. **Feature Prioritization for MVP**\n\n**P0 (Must Have - Core MVP)**\n- User authentication & authorization\n- Basic Dream 100 contact management (CRUD operations)\n- CSV import functionality\n- Teacher dashboard with consultant overview\n- Basic client portal with milestone tracking\n\n**P1 (Should Have - Enhanced MVP)**\n- Email templates and mailto generation\n- Advanced filtering and search\n- File upload for portal documents\n- Basic branding customization\n- Task completion tracking\n\n**P2 (Nice to Have - Future Versions)**\n- Advanced reporting and analytics\n- Bulk email capabilities\n- Mobile app\n- Third-party integrations\n- Advanced customization options\n\n### 5. **Development-Ready Technical Specifications**\n\n#### Environment Setup:\n```json\n// package.json dependencies\n{\n  \"@supabase/supabase-js\": \"^2.x\",\n  \"next\": \"^14.x\",\n  \"react\": \"^18.x\",\n  \"typescript\": \"^5.x\",\n  \"@types/node\": \"^20.x\",\n  \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.x\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Key Configuration:\n- Next.js 14 with App Router\n- TypeScript for type safety\n- Tailwind CSS for styling\n- Supabase client for database operations\n- Vercel for deployment with environment variables\n\n#### Performance Targets:\n- Initial page load: < 2s\n- Subsequent navigation: < 500ms\n- Database queries: < 300ms (90th percentile)\n- File upload progress indicators for files > 1MB\n\n### 6. **Additional Development Considerations**\n\n#### Testing Strategy:\n- Unit tests for utility functions (90% coverage)\n- Integration tests for API endpoints\n- E2E tests for critical user flows\n- Manual testing for file uploads and edge cases\n\n#### Monitoring & Analytics:\n- Error tracking (Sentry or similar)\n- Performance monitoring (Vercel Analytics)\n- User behavior tracking (basic events)\n- Database query performance monitoring\n\n#### Deployment Pipeline:\n- Development \u2192 Staging \u2192 Production workflow\n- Automated testing on PR creation\n- Database migration scripts\n- Environment variable management\n\n### Critical Questions for Development Team:\n\n1. **Authentication Flow**: Should we implement magic link authentication or stick with email/password?\n2. **File Storage**: Should we use Supabase Storage or integrate with AWS S3 for file uploads?\n3. **Real-time Updates**: Do we need real-time dashboard updates using Supabase Realtime?\n4. **Email Integration**: Should MVP include actual email sending or only mailto links?\n5. **Responsive Design**: What's the minimum mobile breakpoint we need to support?\n\nThis enhanced PRD provides the development team with:\n- Clear, testable acceptance criteria\n- Detailed technical specifications\n- Prioritized feature list\n- Specific implementation guidance\n- Risk mitigation strategies\n\nThe team can now begin immediate implementation with a clear understanding of requirements and success criteria."
