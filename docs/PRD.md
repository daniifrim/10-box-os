# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - 10-box OS Web Application

**Draft Version** - *Last Updated: 05:44 PM CEST, Tuesday, July 29, 2025*

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The **"10-box OS"** is a web-based application designed to streamline client acquisition, management, and service delivery for business consultants and coaches. By digitizing the proprietary 10-box framework, the product provides a structured platform to address key friction points such as manual data entry, inefficient outreach, and lack of client visibility into service progress.

### 1.2 The 10-Box Framework

The framework consists of 10 boxes divided into three main sections:

**Section 1: Client Acquisition (Boxes 2-4)**
- **Box 2 - Identify:** Define and refine your avatar/client persona
- **Box 3 - Invite:** Contact prospects from the Dream 100 database
- **Box 4 - Converse:** Conduct discovery calls and convert prospects

**Section 2: Client Service (Boxes 5-7)**
- **Box 5 - Onboard:** Client onboarding process
- **Box 6 - Deliver:** Service delivery with milestone tracking
- **Box 7 - Recap:** Service completion and review

**Section 3: Client Retention (Boxes 8-10)**
- Boxes 8-10 focus on maintaining and expanding client relationships (future scope)

### 1.3 Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Create a productized version of the teacher's intellectual property to manage multiple consultants and their client acquisition processes through the 10-box framework.

**Secondary Goals:**
- Enable the teacher to monitor consultant daily task completion for Boxes 2-4
- Automate client portal creation when prospects convert to clients
- Provide transparent service delivery tracking for clients
- Establish a scalable foundation for future framework expansion

### 1.3 Scope

The MVP focuses on core functionalities for three user personasâ€”Teachers, Consultants, and Clientsâ€”while ensuring usability, security, and performance. Future iterations may include advanced integrations based on user feedback.

## 2. Target Audience and User Personas

### 2.1 Teacher (Framework Owner)

**Description:** The single teacher/owner of the 10-box framework who oversees multiple consultants implementing the methodology. This is a single-tenant application designed specifically for one teacher.

**Needs:**
- Daily monitoring of consultant task completion in Boxes 2-4
- Visibility into consultant client acquisition metrics
- Track average milestone progress across all consultant clients
- Ensure framework adherence and methodology consistency

**Pain Points:**
- Cannot track if consultants are completing daily required tasks
- No visibility into consultant pipeline health
- Difficulty measuring framework effectiveness across the team

### 2.2 Consultants (Students)

**Description:** Business consultants learning and applying the 10-box framework under the teacher's guidance. Each consultant works independently with their own client base.

**Needs:**
- Daily task management system for Boxes 2-4 activities
- Dream 100 database to track and manage prospects
- Automated client portal creation when prospects convert
- Email templates for standardized outreach
- Service delivery tracking with customizable milestones

**Pain Points:**
- Manual tracking of daily framework tasks
- Disorganized prospect management
- Time-consuming client portal setup
- Inconsistent client communication

### 2.3 Clients

**Description:** End clients who have purchased services from consultants. They transition from Dream 100 prospects to active clients when they make a purchase decision.

**Needs:**
- Automatic portal access upon conversion from prospect
- View-only access to service milestones and progress
- Clear visibility of deliverables and timelines
- Consultant-branded experience

**Pain Points:**
- No transparency into service delivery progress
- Uncertainty about project timelines
- Lack of centralized access to project documents

## 3. Market Analysis and Competitive Landscape

### 3.1 Market Overview

The CRM and client management software market is valued at over $40 billion globally, with a projected CAGR of 10% through 2030. Business consultants and coaches represent a growing niche, seeking tailored tools to streamline workflows and differentiate their services.

### 3.2 Competitive Landscape

- **Salesforce:** A leading CRM with extensive features but lacking specific 10-box framework integration
- **HubSpot:** User-friendly CRM with marketing automation; no native support for the 10-box methodology
- **Zoho CRM:** Affordable and customizable, but not optimized for consultants' unique workflows

### 3.3 Unique Value Proposition

The 10-box OS stands out by offering a purpose-built solution for the 10-box framework, combining task tracking, a Dream 100 database, and client portal functionality into a single, intuitive platform tailored for business consultants and coaches.
