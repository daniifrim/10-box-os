## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

**Secondary Goals:**
- Enable teachers to monitor and support consultants effectively
- Provide clients with a transparent, accessible view of service delivery
- Establish a scalable foundation for future feature expansion

### 1.3 Scope

The MVP focuses on core functionalities for three user personasâ€”Teachers, Consultants, and Clientsâ€”while ensuring usability, security, and performance. Future iterations may include advanced integrations based on user feedback.
