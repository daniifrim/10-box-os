# Teacher Dashboard Prototype

This is a fully functional prototype of the 10-box OS Teacher Dashboard, demonstrating the core functionality for monitoring consultant performance and daily task completion.

## Features Demonstrated

### 1. Overview Metrics
- Total consultants count
- Active clients across all consultants  
- Average conversion rate
- Today's compliance percentage with color coding

### 2. Consultant Performance Grid
- **Color-coded status indicators:**
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: All 15 daily tasks completed
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Some tasks incomplete (< 3 days behind)
  - ðŸ”´ **Red**: Multiple overdue tasks (> 3 days behind)

- **Task Progress Bars** for each Box:
  - Box 2 (Identify): Avatar and problem refinement tasks
  - Box 3 (Invite): Dream 100 outreach tasks
  - Box 4 (Converse): Prospect conversation tasks

- **Key Metrics** per consultant:
  - Active clients count
  - Dream 100 contacts count
  - Individual conversion rate
  - Monthly revenue

### 3. Interactive Task Details
- **Click any consultant card** to view detailed task breakdown
- See all 15 daily tasks with completion status
- Tasks organized by Box with visual checkmarks
- Real task titles from the 10-box methodology

### 4. Activity Feed
- Recent consultant actions and system updates
- Conversion events (prospect â†’ client)
- Task completion milestones
- Warning indicators for overdue tasks
- Timeline with relative timestamps

## Accessing the Demo

1. **Development Server**: Navigate to `/teacher-dashboard`
2. **From Homepage**: Click "Dashboard Demo" in the navigation

## Mock Data Scenarios

The prototype includes realistic scenarios showing different consultant performance levels:

- **Sarah Johnson**: Perfect performer (all green)
- **Mike Chen**: Struggling consultant (red status, 3 days behind)
- **Emily Rodriguez**: Mostly compliant (yellow status)
- **David Park**: High performer with minor gaps
- **Lisa Thompson**: Consistent top performer
- **James Wilson**: Solid performer with good metrics

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** components (Card, Dialog)
- **Radix UI** primitives for accessibility
- **Hardcoded JSON data** simulating future Supabase integration

## Key Design Decisions

### Color System
- **Green (#10B981)**: Complete compliance
- **Yellow (#F59E0B)**: Partial compliance with warnings
- **Red (#EF4444)**: Non-compliance requiring attention

### Information Hierarchy
1. **Overview metrics** for quick system health check
2. **Consultant grid** for individual performance scanning
3. **Activity feed** for recent events and trends

### Interactive Elements
- **Hover effects** on consultant cards
- **Click-to-expand** task details
- **Progress bars** with completion percentages
- **Status indicators** with consistent color coding

## Future Supabase Integration Points

The mock data structure is designed to match the planned Supabase schema:

```typescript
// Consultant table
interface Consultant {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  avatar_url: string;
}

// Daily tasks table with RLS
interface DailyTasks {
  consultant_id: string;
  date: string;
  box2_completed: number;
  box3_completed: number; 
  box4_completed: number;
  days_behind: number;
}

// Metrics calculated from clients/prospects tables
interface ConsultantMetrics {
  active_clients: number;
  dream100_contacts: number;
  conversion_rate: string;
  monthly_revenue: string;
}
```

## Testing Scenarios

1. **View overall system health** at a glance
2. **Identify struggling consultants** (red status)
3. **Click consultant cards** to see detailed task breakdown
4. **Monitor activity feed** for recent events
5. **Check compliance trends** via color patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Connect to Supabase** for real data
2. **Add real-time updates** with Supabase subscriptions
3. **Implement task editing** for teachers to mark tasks complete
4. **Add date navigation** to view historical compliance
5. **Include performance charts** and trend analysis

The prototype successfully demonstrates the "wow factor" interface that clearly shows the 10-box framework's power for monitoring consultant performance and ensuring daily task compliance.
